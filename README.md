About
This was a project I completed from Free Code Camp. In it I learned about many basic Javascript functions such as querySelectors, regex, match, etc. Wonderful practice for transfering my python knowledge over to js.

Technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JS
- VScode
- Github Pages


Problems faced/ concepts learned:
- Sometimes converting your knowledge from one language to the syntax of another can be difficult. 
- Improved Vanilla JS skills by learning about Event listeners, query selectors, updating class lists from inside script, regex, match, and much more.
